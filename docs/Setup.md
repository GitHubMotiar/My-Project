### Adding a Git repository
If your documentation is related to source code, Material for MkDocs provides the ability to display information to the project's repository as part of the static site, including stars and forks. Furthermore, the date of last update and creation, as well as contributors can be shown.
#### Configuration
In order to display a link to the repository of your project as part of your documentation, set ```repo_url``` in mkdocs.yml to the public URL of your repository, e.g.:

```repo_url: https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material```
